# pyeep NSFW

[pyeep](https://github.com/spanezz/pyeep) is a hobby attempt at a framework for
interaction design using a variety of input/output devices.

This is a collection of prototype code that I'm refactoring as an extension to
pyeep to support devices for kinky play, such as
[buttplug.io](https://buttplug.io/) controlled devices and
[e-stim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erotic_electrostimulation) devices.

This was presented at the Kinky Geeks Assembly at Chaos Communication Camp 2023:

# Code status

This codebase grew chaotically as a quirky collection of experiments, and I
seriously need to refactor it before I can claim it can be used for general
consumption.

At the moment it's mainly useful as a collection of example code that one is
free to take and integrate in other projects.


# Dependencies
